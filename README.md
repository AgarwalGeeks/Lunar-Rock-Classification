<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Lunar landings by renowned space stations across the world have yielded an abundance of new scientific data on the Moon. The various experiments placed on the surface provided information on seismic, gravitational, and other lunar characteristics. But perhaps the most dramatic result of the missions was returning a total of more than 800 pounds of lunar rock and soil for analysis on Earth. These samples of the Moon offered a deeper appreciation of the evolution of our nearest planetary neighbor. 

Imagine you have been called by one of the largest space stations in the world (XYZ) space station and you are requested to make a Machine Learning model which classifies the different rocks present on the moon's surface. The purpose of this is to make the research process a lot easier. This will reduce the human effort of doing a monotonous task.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>In this dataset, you will find 7534 images of 2 sizes of lunar rocks. In the next 2 months, we challenge you to build models such that given an image, the model will predict the probability of every rock class.</p>
